# guvi_project
The following is the link to the website.

This is my first web development project where the front-end is developed by me and 
the backend is developed with my friend's assistance and with some references.

I have done the sign up and the login part completely upto the backend (php, mysql).

I could not be able to finish the profile page's backend(php, mongodb) as well as redis
on time as the backend development is new for me to develope quickly.

So I submitted the task upto which I can be able to do it on time.
I'll improve myself in this domain with a good practical experience.

Thank you.
